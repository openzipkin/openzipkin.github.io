        Apache Zipkin (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored
        by Incubator. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the
        infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other
        successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or
        stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
