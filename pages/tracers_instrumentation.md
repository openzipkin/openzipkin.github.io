title: Tracers and Instrumentation
weight: 3
---

Tracing information is collected on each host using the instrumented libraries
and sent to Zipkin. When the host makes a request to another application, it passes
a few tracing identifiers along with the request to Zipkin so we can later tie the data
together into spans.

The following libraries exist to provide instrumentation on various platforms.
Please refer to their individual documentation for setup and configuration
guides.

### Supported

The following libraries are supported by the Zipkin team. You can reach out to the team on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin/) chat.
