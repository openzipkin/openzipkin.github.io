  <p>Zipkin is a tracing system originally created by Twitter and is currently run by
the OpenZipkin volunteer organization.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-openzipkin">What is OpenZipkin?</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/openzipkin/">OpenZipkin</a> is the OSS organization that stewards
Zipkin code, docs, specs and support. It includes github projects, this web site,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/zipkin-user">google groups - mailing list</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/zipkinproject">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin">gitter</a>.</p>

<h3 id="keeping-up-to-date">Keeping up to date</h3>
<p>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/zipkinproject">@zipkinproject</a> on Twitter for news
including release announcements and community events. You can also ask on <a href="https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin">gitter</a> about something specific. If you are working on code, you can also
follow projects like the <a href="https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin">server</a> or an <a href="https://zipkin.io/pages/existing_instrumentations.html">instrumentation</a> you use.</p>

<h3 id="being-an-active-part-of-the-community">Being an active part of the community</h3>
<p>OpenZipkin is primarily volunteers, and there are a lot of ways to help. Once you
are on <a href="https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin">gitter</a>, you might notice others asking
questions you once asked. A great way to give-back is to help others who are just
starting. We are at a number of events, and these are a great way to meet others
you collaborate with. You can also host your own Zipkin meetup, similar to how our
<a href="https://zipkin.connpass.com/">Tokyo user group</a> started. If you notice something
interesting on Twitter, tag it with #zipkin so that others can see it. Last, but not
least, you can get involved with the code, docs and project maintenance.</p>

<h3 id="how-change-works-in-zipkin">How change works in Zipkin</h3>
<p>Most OpenZipkin efforts start as localized experiments, then progressively build
traction before becoming a feature. Before you start a large effort, be it docs or
a test framework or a feature, check with one of the above channels. Someone may
already have worked on this in the past and might join your effort. Sometimes,
features are intentionally absent, usually with rationale documented in an issue.
Regardless, the best advice is to join the community before proposing change, and
read one of our <a href="https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/blob/master/HACKING.md">HACKING</a> files
which explains important aspects of change culture.</p>

<h3 id="logos">Logos</h3>
<p><strong><a href="/public/img/zipkin.svg">Zipkin Logo SVG (plain)</a></strong></p>

<p>Use the plain logo for web sites and for printing.
As it is a vector image, it can be scaled without creating pixel artifacts.</p>

<p>It can also be used to print transfer stickers. 
A minimum size for transfer stickers would be 12.5 cm x 7.42 cm. 
Smaller sizes might break the delicate design of the logo.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/public/img/zipkin-cutline.svg">Zipkin Logo SVG (with a cut-line)</a></strong></p>

<p>Use the logo with a cut-line for printing kiss-cut stickers.
A minimum size for kiss-cut stickers would be 7.5 cm x 4.62 cm. 
Smaller sizes might give you problems with the inner corners when you want to peel-off the sticker.</p>
