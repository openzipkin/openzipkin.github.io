**Please do _not_ make pull requests here, but to <https://github.com/apache/incubator-zipkin-website> instead. Thank you!**

With Zipkin moving into Apache Software Foundation incubation, the website source now lives at <https://github.com/apache/incubator-zipkin-website>, and the canonical website is at <https://zipkin.apache.org/>. This repository exists only until a proper migration is implemented away from <https://zipkin.io>.
